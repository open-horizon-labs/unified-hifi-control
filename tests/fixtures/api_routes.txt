# API Routes Contract
# This file is the source of truth for API endpoints.
# Changes require 'api-change-approved' label on PR.
#
# Format: METHOD /path
#
# Note: UI routes (/, /ui/zones, /zone, /hqplayer, /lms, /knobs, /settings)
# are served by Dioxus SPA router (fallback handler), not explicit Axum routes.
# They still work but aren't detected by the route extraction logic.
#
# Note: Embedded asset routes (/favicon.ico, /tailwind.css, /dx-components-theme.css,
# /apple-touch-icon.png) are implementation details, not API contracts. They use
# multi-line closures that the route extractor doesn't detect, and they may change
# with build configuration.
